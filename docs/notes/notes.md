      been put into this project
    * the community is a social network (emphasize this more?)
    * also an education portal for technology !!!
        * education could be free.. adds value to the network !!!
        * hell why not even get paid to be educated on the

        * everything is a component that can simply be "plugged 
          in"
        * even the blockchain !!!
    * total member benefit requires all components be built 
      directly into the platform
    * mention that all existing OSS code can be "deposited" into 
      CodeDepot's "repository"
        * but, all OSS code will be broken down into components 
          where no duplicates are integrated.
            * a new kind of VCS public repository system !!!
    * TRANSPARENCY !!!
* centralization causes problems
